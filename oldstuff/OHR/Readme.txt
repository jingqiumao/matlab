1.edit ba file. replace 'SuperchargerOff' to 'Superchrgeroff'.
  Reason: this variable is too long and my program cant separate it from the one next to it.
If you dont like it, just run MixRat program to load all the variables and jump to step 3.
2.run loadOHR_arctas
3.run calOHR_arctas
4.run plotOHR2_arctas.
